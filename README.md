# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project(Case Study 1 : Cyclistic)

This project is about a fictional company named Cyclistic, and it is a bike-share company bases in Chicago. I am working for the company as a Junior Analyst, 
and I will meet different characters and team members in the Marketing Analyst Department in the course of my work. In data analytics generally, key business questions
to be answered in order to make data-driven decisions will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. According
to what I learnt in Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course, the stages involved in Data Analysis are Asking questions, Preparation of data, Processing 
of data from dirty to clean, Analyze data to answer data-driven questions, Sharing of data, and Act. 

**About the company**
In 2016, Cyclistic Bike Share from California launched a successful bike-share offering. Ever since, the Bike-Share program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked by riders from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime and get locked. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s stakeholders concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.  Stakeholders want to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, our marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The Director of Marketing(Mr. Moreno) and our Marketing Analyst Team Manager are responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote bike-share programmes. While our team is interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

**Scenario:** I am tasked to identify how the casual riders and annual members use our bikes differently and make necessary recommendations to the stakeholders. 

**My Role:** I am a Junior Data Analyst in a Marketing Analyst Team at Cyclistic Bike-Share Company in Chicago. 

**Goal of the Project:** To design strategies of converting casual riders to annual members

## Stage 1: ASK
**Business Question :** I have been assigned to answer this question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? This question needs to be answered in order to make data-driven decisions in our Bike-Share Company Cyclistic.

## Stage 2: PREPARE
Stage 2: PREPARE
According to improvado blog site, Data preparation is the act of aggregating raw data and transforming it into a format that can be easily analyzed. This can be simply put as the process of collecting and storing data for analysis. Since I know the question that needs to be answered, I will go ahead to briefly explain how I prepared and processed my data. 

On the 25th of September, 2022, I downloaded the last 12 months data. So, I downloaded data within September 2021 - August 2022 from this [site](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). September 2022 data was not available at the time I started the project. All the data were in zip files in csv format. I extracted them, and downloaded the files. Another folder is then created to convert the data into worksheets. After I had extracted the files, all the 12 months data to be analyzed can be found here in udrop folder. All the data were put in their column to better study them.

## Stage 2: PROCESS
During this stage I clean and check the data information to ensure its integrity. After thoroughly studied the downloaded data and went through the business questions, I realized that two additional columns will be needed at this point for all the 12 months data: 
a) ride_length( ended_at column minus started_at column). The started_at column and ended_at column contain the time that each rider started and ended their journeys respectively. 
b) day_of_week is calculated to be the day of the week for each trip.  I have to do this for all the 12 files since it will be too big for excel to merge them together. I saved the calculated data in a separate folder.

I made use of excel extensively by working on the data on worksheets(xlsx). In all the 12 months data, each of them has three sheets in them. One is for the raw data, while the second and the third sheets are working sheets and pivot tables. I created pivot tables for each data. Some of the values that were calculated include: Total number of member-casual base on types of rideable type, Total number of member-casual base on users(heavy, low, and normal users), Average ride length, maximum ride length, number of riders on weekdays base on member-casual. Because of time, I did not go further with creating a dashboard on excel since I will do that eventually for visualization.n. By making my hands dirty, the working sheets and pivot tables for all the twelve months can be seen in this [udrop](https://www.udrop.com/folder/8ab1c577fbb32925cc6e24ec20801e61/Worksheet_for_pivot_tabele-_Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Data).

 I wanted to use SQL at first but since R was taught in the course also, I decided to enhance my R skills with other tasks such as merging of the 12 files, creation of more tables, format and transformation of data. 
 
## Stage 4: ANALYSE
 As stated above, R was used to format and transform and merged data. Our data is sorted, filtered and columns that are not needed are deleted while more columns are added.

My full R code  is provided here on my [github](https://github.com/Gokoyer/Cyclistic-Data-Analytics/blob/master/2_cyclistic_30_9.R). For the sake of clarity and conciseness, I exclude all my mistakes and errors.
Below are all the new columns that were added to the merged data file:
i) ride_length - this is the time each rider travels in a single trip.The difference between the ended_at time and started_at time will result in ride_length. Difftime function is used and the resultant value is converted to minutes. all_12months_data$ride_length <- difftime(cyclistic_df$ended_at, cyclistic_df$started_at, units = "mins")

ii)ride_date:- Started_at date is used. The function that is applied here is 
as.Date. all_12months_data$ride_date <- as.Date(all_12months_data$started_at)

iii) day_of_week :- In this column, it shows days in numerical form(1=Sunday, 2= Monday, 3 = Tuesday, 4= wednesday, 5= Thursday, 6= Friday, 7=Saturday) in which riders start their journey. wday function is used. By default, 1 stands for Sunday. 

iv) Name of day of week :- This data represents the day names(Sunday, Monday and etc) The function that is used here is format
(as.Date(Data)). 
 all_12months_data$day_of_week <- wday(all_12months_data$started_at) .

v) month :- In this column, corresponding months that riders started their journeys are represented by numbers where for example “9” stands for September.
all_12months_data$month <- format(as.Date(all_12months_data$ride_date), "%m") Other codes can be found in [R code](https://github.com/Gokoyer/Cyclistic-Data-Analytics/blob/master/2_cyclistic_30_9.R). 


## Stage 5: SHARE 
 Since Tableau is the visualization tool that we used in Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I decided to use it. Some of the visualizations that were created can be seen below:

## Stage 6: ACT
###**Conclusion:**
I completed  my analysis and visualizations, so final CONCLUSION are as follows:
Total rides within September 2021- August 2022 = 4,559,680

Total rides by riders with membership within the same period = 2,681,916

Total rides by casual riders = 1,877, 764.

The most used Rideable Type = Classic bikes

The least used Rideable type = docked bike

Docked bikes were used only by casual riders

The busiest weekday in terms of Ride length = Sunday

Casual riders generally spend more time riding than members i.e casuals ride length is more than that of members

The busiest weekday in terms of number of rides is Saturday

The busiest season is Summer with total rides equals 1,868,202

The busiest month is July with total rides =  642,621

The busiest time of the day is 17.00 which has total rides = 469,475


Marketing Analyst Team Insights:
One of the insights that our team gained during the course of the analysis is that the number of members at Cyclistic is 48% more than those that ride casually. In our opinion, it is believed that it is more economical to use bikes as members other than casual.  

At Chicago based bike-share company, Classic bikes are the most popular rideable type among the users while docked bikes are not popular among the users. What this may mean is that Classic bikes are not as complicated to use as the other two rideable types. The reason docked types are the least popular among riders may be because the bikes are docked and locked down, and this may take additional periods of time and be stressful to undock. 

Saturday and Sunday are the busiest days in the week. The busiest weekday in terms of number of rides is Saturday while the busiest weekday in terms of Ride length is Sunday. This is the weekend. I think this is due to the fact that more people have free time during these days than any other days in the week. Some of the users may ride because of leisure and have fun particularly when the weather is brightest.

Summer with the brightest weather is the busiest season across all the year. Undoubtedly, this is because outdoor activities used to increase significantly during this period of the year. So, it is understandable that more riders will patronize Cyclistic.

The busiest month and time of the day is July and 17.00. It is noted that July is the busiest month of july. This is because July is the peak during the summer season and more people used to go for their annual vacation at this time.

Implementation of Insights:
Sensitization and awareness should be created via printing and electronic   media that it is pocket friendly to be members of Cyclistic other than casual riders. It is essential to let casual riders realize how much money that will be saved within one year if they convert to members.

In case class bikes and electric bikes are more cost effective than docked bikes, our team will suggest that docked bikes should be abolished. This development may encourage casual members to change to members and this may also attract new riders to join our family.

SInce it has been established that weekends are always busiest during the weekdays, stakeholders should look at ways to provide discounts on weekends in order to maximize profit on weekends.

This same strategy to be applied on weekends can also be employed during the summer season as well. This is to give opportunities to potential riders that are not financially buoyant to patronize Cyclistic. A very good example are pupils that will be on long vacation in summer.
