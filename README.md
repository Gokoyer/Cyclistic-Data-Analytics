# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project(Case Study 1 : Cyclistic)

This project is about a fictional company named Cyclistic, and it is a bike-share company bases in Chicago. I am working for the company as a Junior Analyst, 
and I will meet different characters and team members in the Marketing Analyst Department in the course of my work. In data analytics generally, key business questions
to be answered in order to make data-driven decisions will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. According
to what I learnt in Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course, the stages involved in Data Analysis are Asking questions, Preparation of data, Processing 
of data from dirty to clean, Analyze data to answer data-driven questions, Sharing of data, and Act. 

####**About the company**
In 2016, Cyclistic Bike Share from California launched a successful bike-share offering. Ever since, the Bike-Share program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked by riders from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime and get locked. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s stakeholders concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.  Stakeholders want to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, our marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The Director of Marketing(Mr. Moreno) and our Marketing Analyst Team Manager are responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote bike-share programmes. While our team is interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

####**Scenario:** I am tasked to identify how the casual riders and annual members use our bikes differently and make necessary recommendations to the stakeholders. 

**My Role:** I am a Junior Data Analyst in a Marketing Analyst Team at Cyclistic Bike-Share Company in Chicago. 

**Goal of the Project:** To design strategies of converting casual riders to annual members

## Stage 1: ASK
**Business Question :** I have been assigned to answer this question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? This question needs to be answered in order to make data-driven decisions in our Bike-Share Company Cyclistic.
